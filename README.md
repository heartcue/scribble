# scribble

Automation script for the Stone Story RPG.
Equips weapons, uses abilities, deals with bosses!
Also shows ability cooldowns and buff/debuff info.

Pull requests and bug reports are very welcome.

## Prerequisites

Finish main story to unlock the Mindstone

## How to use

Copy contents of `scribble.txt` into your mindstone and configure your weapons and runtime settings at the top

## Limitations

- Only tested on iOS version
- Tested mostly on blue-level zones (6 to 10 stars) and a bit on white-levels (1-5)
- Support only the following Lost Items (because I don't have the rest): `Skeleton Arm`, `Bashing Shield`, `Blade of the Fallen God`
- Doesn't support staffs or warhammers

## Development

I use VSCode with a [syntax highlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Catalyst-42.c42-stonescript) for StoneScript
